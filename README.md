## Installation

To use this program, simply copy the `./script.js` file into a bookmark. 
Then, navigate to [Chrome Webstore Invalid Link](https://https://chrome.google.com/webstoreb) (It is okay that this is invalid, we want to run this from a Google ChromeOS Website.)

Then, run the script, and the GUI should appear. 

Disable and run as you wish.
